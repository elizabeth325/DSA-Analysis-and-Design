# DSA-Analysis-and-Design


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem that I was solving was allowing computer science advisors more easily access class information.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by trying to gain an understanding of what each component does and trying to write them in the best possible way. Understanding data structures is crucial for this as they allow you to pick the proper data structure to optimize your code.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I overcame any roadblocks by breaking down the problem into little chunks. From there I would tackle the chunks one piece at a time. This allowed me to solve problems that looked big and intimidating.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project has shown me the importance of modularizing my code from the very start of my planning. Keeping all of the reuqirements and then later the code in their oppropriate little boxes allowed me to stay focused on one thing at a time.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  My work on this project has led me to believe that a combination of modularization and well organized comments keeps my programs maintanable, readable, and adaptable.
